# Java Data Structures Practice

This repository contains simple and foundational implementations of basic Data Structures and Algorithms using Java. It's a great starting point for learners who want to understand how these structures work internally and how basic sorting and recursion can be implemented manually.

## 📁 Included Files

| File Name             | Description                          |

| `ArraySetOne.java`   | Demonstrates a simple set using arrays. |
| `BubbleSort.java`    | Basic implementation of the Bubble Sort algorithm. |
| `DoublyLinkedList.java` | Operations on a doubly linked list (insert, delete, display). |
| `InsertionSort.java` | Basic implementation of the Insertion Sort algorithm. |
| `RecursionPractice.java` | Examples to understand basic recursion techniques. |
| `SelectionSort.java` | Basic implementation of the Selection Sort algorithm. |
| `SinglyLinkedList.java` | Operations on a singly linked list. |

## ✅ Key Concepts Covered

- Arrays and Set logic
- Sorting Algorithms:
  - Bubble Sort
  - Insertion Sort
  - Selection Sort
- Linked Lists:
  - Singly Linked List
  - Doubly Linked List

- Recursion Techniques

## 💡 How to Run

Ensure Java is installed. Compile and run individual files using:

```bash
javac FileName.java
java FileName
```

> Replace `FileName` with the class name (matching the file name) you'd like to run.
