|-------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `ArraySetOne.java` | Demonstrates operations on arrays like reversal, swapping, printing in order/reverse |
| `BubbleSort.java`  | Implements the classic Bubble Sort algorithm with sorting logic         |

## 💡 Topics Covered

- ✅ Array creation and traversal  
- ✅ Array reversal (in-place and output-only)  
- ✅ Swapping first and last elements in an array  
- ✅ Bubble Sort  
- ✅ Using loops and recursion for array manipulation  
- ✅ Basic I/O operations in Java

## 🚀 How to Run

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
   cd your-repo-name
   ```

2. **Compile and run a Java file:**
   ```bash
   javac ArraySetOne.java
   java ArraySetOne
   ```

   Replace `ArraySetOne` with the name of any class containing the `main()` method.

## 🧠 Concepts Practiced

- Arrays and indexing  
- Sorting algorithms (Bubble Sort)  
- Conditionals and loops  
- Java syntax and I/O  
- Recursion (planned for future)

## 📌 Next Steps (To-Do)

- [ ] Add recursion examples (e.g., factorial, Fibonacci)  
- [ ] Add LinkedList implementation  
- [ ] Add Stack and Queue examples  
- [ ] Add searching algorithms (Linear/Binary Search)
